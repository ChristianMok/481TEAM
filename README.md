## Project idea <a name = "project_idea"></a>
Every year, Canadians throw away 2.2 million tonnes of food that could be eaten. Another issue in Canada is obesity (30% of Canadians are obese). Our new mobile application HealthEat™ aims to reduce both of these issues. Superstores, Sobeys… have implemented a system to order your groceries online, HealthEat™ will be connected to the reward cards of the supermarkets to keep track of food you have in your fridge, the food you have purchased and has the ability to suggest a grocery list based on a meal plan that will do based on your food preferences. HealthEat™ is paving the way for a healthier and greener future.




## Stakeholder <a name = "stakeholder"></a>
* Food providers (Supermarkets, Amazon™).<br />
* Fitness trainers, fitness trackers/applications.<br />
* End users.<br />
* Local Government (Food waste, garbage collection).<br />
* Health System, Insurance Companies (Healthier people = Less doctor visits).<br />
* Database owners (application requires a large amount of memory).<br />



## User Research Methods <a name = "user_research_methods"></a>

### Survey <a name = "survey"></a>

#### 1.Survey Summary <a name = "surveysummary"></a>
During our survey process, we received responses from a wide range of people, both in age and occupation. Our survey captured mostly Student and Full-Time employees between 18-25 and 41-65 years of age. Our survey found that a large majority (>80%) of respondents own a smartphone, are interested in increasing the healthiness of their diet, and do not currently use any method of tracking their eating. These results show that there are relevant end users for our application. Our survey also found that the main reason that people stop using food tracking apps is because entering each item individually is too much work. Users also stated that it is difficult to get into the routine of tracking food and very easy to fall out of the routine.
Our survey found that respondents will follow recipes about half the time they are cooking, and more than half are interested in trying new recipes. This result shows that the recipe feature will be useful in our application. 
Finally, we saw that most people (>50%) are not checking their refrigerators, pantries and cupboards for expired food weekly. This may cause some food items to go bad unnoticed. In our survey we found that ⅓ of respondents threw away more than 10%, on average, of the food they purchased.

### Extreme Interview via personas <a name = "extremeinterivewviapersonas"></a>
#### 1.Extreme Interview Summary  <a name = "extremeinterviewsummary"></a>
What we found valuable from Valerie’s interview is that people may use more than one application to track their diet since some apps have unique features that the user likes compared to another but is lacking another important feature. This means that it is crucial that our application can combine the positives of the different apps so users can have one app that meets all their needs. This would allow the user to be more satisfied and accomplish their tasks more quickly.
	Valerie also really values the feature of our app that will remind her when she has food that is about to go bad. Valerie likes that our app can directly link up with a users's grocery rewards cards to track what has been purchased saving her plenty of time that she would spend to scan or input everything. Lastly, Valerie and Hubbert both think the apps capability to let them know of discounts on their favorite food items is unique and a very good idea to help them save money. Hubbert also really likes the feature that allows him to order his food right on the app so he doesn't have to leave his house.

## Task Description <a name ="task_descriptions"></a> 

### TASK 1: CREATING A PROFILE + INSTALLING THE APP<a name ="task1"></a> 
#### From the systems perspective is routine but it’s an infrequent but important task for the user. Simple task

   Margot is a 70-year-old woman who has been diagnosed with diabetes. Her daughter, who has used HealthEat for a couple of years (successful app here!) recommends it to her. She wants to live to see her grandchildren grow up so she is motivated to adapt to new times.

   She takes her smartphone (she’s been using it for one year now and she successfully messages with her grandchildren via whatsapp) and goes to the App Store, where she types HealthEat, the first suggestion is in fact, the app her daughter described her. She reads carefully all the Terms & Conditions (she doesn’t understand the younglings of today… never reading a contract *sigh*). It seems although the app asks for some personal information it’s save, she doesn't want Mark Zuckerberg to look how much she eats…

   When she gets inside the app, the app greets her (it has accessed her personal information via Health so it knows that Margot has diabetes). The app confirms all her information (name, phone, health issues, allergies…) are correct and asks her where she likes to buy things: “WholeFoods of course”. The app asks her if she has a rewards card, which she does (this will connect the app to the info of her shopping cart: elements, expiry date, nutritious info…).
The app asks her to put the card in the rectangle of the screen which she happily does (those were a lot of numbers to type…). 

### TASK 2: INPUT RECIPES<a name ="task2"></a> 
#### Routine and simple task.

Robert, Margot’s grandchild, wants to input her delicious pancake recipe in the system so he can cook it when he goes abroad. She always answers that she calculates the ingredient amount but in a couple of months using the app she has learnt to share recipes which she tries to do. She finds it really difficult because her phone offers her a lot of sharing ways so she gives Robert the ingredients and recipe hand-written.
Robert goes to the add recipe tabs where the first option that appears to him is to input one ingredient and its weight (in case there is a concrete brand option we could add it here). Once he is done adding all the ingredients, the app gives him the chance to write the recipe step by step (it could calculate the time needed to do it) and name it. The app alphabetically sorts the recipe within “Desserts”.

### TASK 3: MEAL PLANNING (Select the recipes)<a name ="task3"></a> 
#### Routine and simple task.

Megan is a 20-year-old university student who is starting exercise to lose weight. In this case she wants to build nice eating habits. And she starts using this HealthEat app found inside app store. She creates her account and built her initial profile. 
First week, she input the diet style and budget of this week. Then pages of recommended recipes appear. She looks through these recipes and selects 3 types of salad, Caesar salad, Cobb salad and pasta salad, and she select the “automatic generate recipes for me” at the end of the page. 

### TASK 4: REARRANGE WEEKLY MENU<a name ="task4"></a> 
#### Routine and simple task.

Vince is a university student with a very volatile schedule. HealthEat has recommended a weekly menu with a Beef souffle for Tuesday, but Vince has a group meeting that limits the time that he has available to cook his dinner. He decides to swap the meal for Tuesday with the meal planned for Friday, a simple pan-fried chicken recipe that will take much less time to prepare and cook. 
HealthEat automatically rearranges the weekly menu to find another day with enough prep time for the Beef souffle meal or will find an alternate recipe with similar ingredients to substitute if there are no days with a suitable amount of time for the Beef souffle meal.

### TASK 5: CREATE SHOPPING LIST (Recipe → Buy food) <a name ="task5"></a> 
#### Routine and simple task.

Christian is a 40-year-old super healthy guy who really cares about the taste and appearance of the food, because of that, he likes to find and reproduce new recipes every day.
As always, HealthEat provides him a list of recipes and he selects the recipe called Rosemary Roasted Potatoes, a classic combination that never gets old. HealthEat looks for all the ingredients that are needed for the recipes and a list of stores where you can buy them. HealthEat also provides two options to Christian: either he can go to the store to buy the ingredients himself or he can ask for the delivery service associated to his rewards card. Christian selects the delivery service and the payment is done automatically. The food will be delivered to his place as soon as possible.

### TASK 6: RECIPE RECOMMENDATION (Buy food → Recipe)<a name ="task6"></a> 
#### Routine and simple task.

Nick is a 33-year-old male and a full time employee at a mechanics shop. He has recently become aware of how much food he is wasting and wants to cut back on his waste for the sake of his wallet and the environment. The HealthEat app was suggested to him by a co-worker since it has the capability to suggest recipes based on the food you have purchased prioritizing the items that are nearing their expiry date.
On a Monday evening Nick goes to the Superstore near his house and purchases a variety of his favorite food items. Nick has his Superstore rewards card hooked up to his HealthEat app and when he checks his phone after getting home he sees a notification from HealthEat reading “Hi Nick! We noticed you recently bought some groceries and would like to remind you of the unused Broccoli in your fridge! Here are some recipes for you:” 
When Nick opens HealthEat and goes to the ‘Suggested Recipes’ section there is a list of recipes he could make with what is in his fridge with the recipes using broccoli at the top. Nick chooses the first recipe, chicken broccoli stir fry, and starts cooking! Nick then rates the recipe as 5 stars since it was easy to make, healthy and tasted delicious.
