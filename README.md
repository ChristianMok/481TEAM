### Project idea <a name = "project_idea"></a>
Every year, Canadians throw away 2.2 million tonnes of food that could be eaten. Another issue in Canada is obesity (30% of Canadians are obese). Our new mobile application HealthEat™ aims to reduce both of these issues. Superstores, Sobeys… have implemented a system to order your groceries online, HealthEat™ will be connected to the reward cards of the supermarkets to keep track of food you have in your fridge, the food you have purchased and has the ability to suggest a grocery list based on a meal plan that will do based on your food preferences. HealthEat™ is paving the way for a healthier and greener future.
